            While Poha is a popular Marathi breakfast item made from beaten rice, vegetables and spices, Jalebi is a delicious sweet widely relished in North India. Although these two dishes are usually served separately in other states, people in Indore prefer having poha and jalebi together. The spicy and tangy poha tastes amazing with small bites of crispy jalebis.
